Dear Sir/Madam,

I am applying for Summer Internship Software Intern - 2014. 

This is Surya Manickam Krishna currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at Syracuse University. 

I am not a geek, I am not a nerd, I am just a simple normal person who loves 

i) food.
ii) challenging problems.
iii) makings things which makes life simpler.

Let me list a couple of things which I have done

i) Maintained a prestigious blog amazingstuffs.blogspot.com 

ii) Wrote a SearchTab Firefox addon. Code is @ https://github.com/suryak , It seriously made my browing activity easier and saved a lot of time not only for me but for others too.

iii) Worked in a Adobe for an year on the domain Search Engine Marketing, Where my job is to write python scripts to pull the data from the Microsoft AdCenter and put it in our PostgreSQL database. 

iv) Started a small Startup www.krizda.com which was built in ruby on rails with spree commerce plugin. Its an online marketplace selling gold jewellery. Due to more inclination towards technology, I chose to do my higher education. 


Why I would like to work at nodejitsu

i) Its a Startup with a perfect combination of people. I can learn exponentially all the new things. 

ii) Cloud computing and server side programming is what I want to work on. It perfectly matches my interest.

Thanks
Surya
